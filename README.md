# Learnipy - A Collaborative Student Discussion Board

## What is Learnipy?
Learniply is a website I built from the ground up using the Codeigniter framework. 
The site is a small scale discussion board that allows students to post and respond to questions and allows staff to moderate and endorse answers.

The website is currently deployed on UQ Cloud zones and can be accessed at this link. Due to it being deployed on UQ servers it may require a UQ login 
to see.
