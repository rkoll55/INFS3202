# Learnipy - A Collaborative Student Discussion Board

## What is Learnipy?
Learniply is a website I built from the ground up using the Codeigniter framework. 
The site is a small scale discussion board that allows students to post and respond to questions and allows staff to moderate and endorse answers.
